      <h1>Dear TechCrunch Readers,</h1>
      <p>
        We hope this email finds you well. We wanted to share two
        thought-provoking articles that were recently published on our website.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first article, titled "<a
          href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/12/ai-search-effects-implications/"
          >As AI consumes search, what will be left for us humans?</a
        >", was written by Alex Wilhelm. It explores the potential implications
        of AI advancements in the search industry. With AI algorithms becoming
        increasingly sophisticated, there is growing concern about what role
        humans will play in the search process moving forward. The author
        discusses the ways in which AI may impact job security and the
        importance of human intuition and creativity in the search process. We
        encourage you to give it a read and share your thoughts in the comments
        section.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second article, "<a
          href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/14/u-s-tech-policy-must-keep-pace-with-ai-innovation/"
          >US tech policy must keep pace with AI innovation</a
        >", was written by Rudina Seseri. It highlights the importance of
        policymakers staying up-to-date with AI advancements. As AI continues to
        revolutionize various industries, it is crucial that tech policy keeps
        pace with these innovations. The author argues that the US government
        must take a proactive approach in shaping AI policy and regulations,
        rather than reacting to the impacts of AI after the fact.
