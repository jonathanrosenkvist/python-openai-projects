# OpenAI Projects

Some projects using OpenAI APIs with Python.

## Features

- setting up a dev environment to run Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code.
- hiding our API key.
- defining max_tokens.
- stopping sequences.
- generating N choices and echoing the prompt.
- understanding the various completion models.
- comparing model performance and pricing.

## Setup

You need to create a virtual env and install the packages listed in `requirements.txt`. You can then run Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code.
