# OpenAI Projects

Some projects using OpenAI APIs with Python.

## Setup

You need to create a virtual env and install the packages listed in `requirements.txt`. You can then run Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code.

Based on [Mastering OpenAI Python APIs: Unleash the Power of GPT4](https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-openai/) by Colt Steele (2023).
